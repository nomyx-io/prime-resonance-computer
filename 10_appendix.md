## Glossary of Terms

**Entropic Resonance**: The foundational theoretical framework describing how prime numbers create distinctive resonance patterns through their unique entropic properties.

**Hilbert Space**: A mathematical vector space with an inner product that allows length and angle measurement, used in the theoretical formulation of prime resonance computing.

**Oscillator**: An electronic circuit that produces a periodic signal; in this system, oscillators tuned to prime frequencies (2Hz, 3Hz, 5Hz) form the computational basis.

**Phase Detector**: A circuit that measures the phase difference between two oscillator signals, outputting a voltage proportional to this difference.

**Phase Relationship**: The relative timing difference between two oscillating signals, measured in degrees (0-360°) or radians (0-2π).

**Phase Synchronization**: The process where oscillator phases lock into specific relationships, a key mechanism in prime resonance computing.

**Prime Computer**: A non-conventional computing system that leverages the unique properties of prime numbers for computation, particularly through resonance phenomena.

**Prime Number**: A natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).

**Prime Resonance**: The phenomenon where systems exhibit distinctive resonant behavior in response to prime number patterns.

**Resonance**: A phenomenon where a system vibrates with greater amplitude at certain frequencies, called resonant frequencies.

**Resonance Channel**: A specific pathway or mode through which resonance information propagates in a system.

**Resonance Pattern**: A distinctive configuration of phase relationships and oscillation characteristics that emerges in response to specific numerical inputs.

**Triadic Resonance**: A three-part resonance relationship formed by the interaction of three prime-frequency oscillators, fundamental to the operation of the Prime Resonance Computer.

**Zeta Function**: The Riemann zeta function, which has deep connections to the distribution of prime numbers and informs aspects of prime resonance theory.

## Theoretical Background

### Prime Numbers and Resonance

The theoretical foundation of the Prime Resonance Computer draws from several areas of mathematics and physics:

1. **Number Theory**: The fundamental properties of prime numbers, their distribution, and relationships
2. **Dynamical Systems**: How coupled oscillators develop complex behaviors and synchronization patterns
3. **Information Theory**: The entropy and information content of number sequences
4. **Quantum Mechanics**: Wave function concepts that parallel phase relationships in oscillator networks
5. **Complex Systems**: Emergence of ordered patterns from simple interacting components

The key insight is that prime numbers, when encoded as oscillation patterns, create distinctive resonance signatures that can be measured and utilized for computation.

### Entropic Resonance Framework

The Entropic Resonance Framework proposes that:

1. Each number has a unique "entropic signature" related to its prime factorization
2. Prime numbers have maximally distinctive entropic signatures
3. These signatures can be physically realized through coupled oscillator systems
4. The resulting resonance patterns can perform specific computational tasks

The mathematics behind this framework involves concepts from information theory, particularly the notion of "symbolic entropy collapse" when non-prime numbers are processed by the system.
