# Prime Resonance Computer: Complete Instruction Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive instruction guide for building, programming, and operating your own Prime Resonance Computer for under $500. This guide consolidates all the necessary information, from the underlying theoretical principles to detailed assembly instructions and advanced applications.

The Prime Resonance Computer is a unique device that explores a novel computational paradigm based on the fascinating relationship between prime numbers and physical resonance phenomena. By following this guide, you will construct a working system that demonstrates these principles and can be used for mathematical exploration, research, and educational purposes.

This document is organized into logical sections to guide you through the entire process, from understanding the theory to operating your completed system.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with the [Project Overview](./02_project_overview.md) to get a high-level understanding of the system and its requirements. Then, delve into the [Theoretical Background](./01-theory/theoretical_background.md) to grasp the fundamental principles. The guide then proceeds through hardware assembly, firmware setup, calibration, and operation.

Each section is designed to build upon the previous one, providing a logical progression through the build and usage process.

Thank you for your interest in the Prime Resonance Computer project. We hope you find this guide informative and engaging!
