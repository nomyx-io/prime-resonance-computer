# Prime Computer Documentation Project

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for creating detailed documentation on how to build a prime computer system based on the Prime Resonance Hypothesis framework. The prime computer utilizes coupled oscillators tuned to prime-number frequencies to enable a new paradigm of computation beyond traditional binary logic, leveraging resonance, phase synchronization, and symbolic collapse principles.

The goal is to produce complete documentation for building a full-featured prime computer system with 20+ interconnected nodes for under $600, capable of running applications in quantum-inspired AI and consciousness research. The system will support both wired and wireless communication between nodes and offer multiple interface options.

#### 7.2 Development Workflow

1. **Research Phase:**
   - Conduct detailed research on prime resonance theory
   - Evaluate component options and alternatives
   - Benchmark existing oscillator designs

2. **Prototyping Phase:**
   - Develop single-node prototype
   - Test basic communication between two nodes
   - Validate phase synchronization and resonance collapse

3. **Documentation Development:**
   - Create documentation concurrently with design
   - Use iterative approach, validating instructions during prototyping
   - Develop modular documentation that allows for various build options

4. **Review and Refinement:**
   - Test documentation with sample users
   - Refine based on feedback
   - Verify cost estimates with actual component pricing

5. **Final Package Compilation:**
   - Compile all documentation into structured repository
   - Create detailed table of contents and index
   - Produce supplementary material (videos, interactive guides)

This implementation strategy ensures that we maintain a systematic, validated approach to developing the comprehensive prime computer documentation.
