## Project Overview

The Prime Resonance Computer is an innovative computational device that uses coupled oscillators tuned to prime frequencies to perform mathematical operations, particularly those related to prime numbers and factorization. This project explores the fascinating intersection between number theory, physical resonance phenomena, and unconventional computing paradigms.

Unlike conventional digital computers that process information through binary logic gates, the Prime Resonance Computer leverages the distinctive resonance patterns that emerge when oscillators are tuned to prime frequencies. This approach allows for a direct physical manifestation of certain mathematical properties, creating a unique platform for both practical computation and theoretical exploration.
