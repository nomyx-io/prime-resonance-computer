## Cost-Saving Options

To reduce costs further:

1. **Start with a single node**: Build one complete node first (~$165), then expand.
2. **Use breadboards instead of custom PCBs**: Save $15 on PCB production.
3. **Use existing tools**: If you already have basic electronics tools, save $40.
4. **Substitute the Raspberry Pi**: Use an old laptop as the coordinator node.
5. **Use fewer display components**: The OLED displays can be reduced to 1 initially.
6. **3D print locally**: Many libraries and makerspaces offer free or low-cost 3D printing.

## Special Notes

### Key Component Selection

1. **ESP32 Selection**: Look for modules with external antenna for better network performance
2. **555 Timer Precision**: For oscillators, consider higher-grade options like:
   - Texas Instruments NA555P (higher precision)
   - Maxim ICM7555 (lower power consumption)
   - Intersil ICM7556 (dual timer version)
3. **Passives Quality**: Use 1% tolerance resistors and low-drift capacitors for oscillator circuits
4. **Power Supply Stability**: Clean power is essential for stable oscillations. Consider:
   - Low-noise LDO regulators
   - Additional filtering capacitors
   - Separate power domains for digital and analog sections

### Component Substitutions

The prime computer design is flexible and can accommodate different components:

- **Controller Alternatives**: Arduino Nano, STM32 "Blue Pill", Teensy LC
- **Oscillator Alternatives**: Crystal oscillators, RC networks, LC oscillators
- **Phase Detection Alternatives**: Analog multiplier, digital phase detector, microcontroller timed capture

### Quantity Adjustments

Build costs can be adjusted by changing the number of nodes:

- **Single Node**: ~$165
- **Dual Node**: ~$320
