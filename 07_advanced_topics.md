## Custom Software Development

### Firmware Modification

The open-source firmware can be extended to implement custom functionality:

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Clone the repository from GitHub
   - Review the code structure and architecture documentation
   - Set up the recommended IDE (Arduino IDE or PlatformIO)

2. **Key Components to Modify**
   - `Oscillator.cpp` - Oscillator control and monitoring
   - `PhaseDetector.cpp` - Phase relationship detection
   - `ComputeEngine.cpp` - Core computational algorithms
   - `NetworkManager.cpp` - Inter-node communication

3. **Example: Adding a New Computational Algorithm**

class ComputeEngine {
public:
    // Existing methods...
    
    // Add new method declaration
    bool performTwinPrimeSearch(uint32_t start, uint32_t end, 
                               std::vector<std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t>>& results);
};

// In ComputeEngine.cpp
bool ComputeEngine::performTwinPrimeSearch(uint32_t start, uint32_t end, 
                                          std::vector<std::pair<uint32_t, uint32_t>>& results) {
    results.clear();
    
    // Simple implementation - can be optimized
    for (uint32_t n = start; n <= end - 2; n++) {
        // Use existing isPrime method
        if (isPrime(n) && isPrime(n + 2)) {
            results.push_back(std::make_pair(n, n + 2));
            
            // Apply resonance feedback
            oscillatorManager.injectResonancePattern(n);
            delay(50); // Allow system to stabilize
        }
    }

}
```

### Prime Computation Scripting Language (PCSL)

For non-programmers, the Prime Computation Scripting Language provides a simpler interface for creating custom computations:

1. **Basic PCSL Syntax**

```
// Comments start with //

// Setting parameters
SET parameter_name value

// Controlling oscillators
OSC_TUNE 1 2.00      // Tune oscillator 1 to 2.00 Hz
OSC_ENABLE 1 true    // Enable oscillator 1

// Reading phase information
phase = PHASE_READ 1 2    // Read phase between oscillators 1 and 2

// Conditional logic
IF condition THEN
    statements
ELSE
    statements
END

// Looping
FOR i = start TO end
    statements
END

// Output and results
PRINT "Text and variables: " + variable
RESULT_SET name value    // Set a result value
```

2. **Example PCSL Script: Prime Testing Algorithm**

```pcsl
// Prime Detection Script
// Tests if input number N is prime using resonance patterns

// Store input number
N = INPUT_NUMBER

// Configure oscillators for test
OSC_TUNE 1 2.00
OSC_TUNE 2 3.00
OSC_TUNE 3 5.00
OSC_ENABLE_ALL true

// Inject the number as an entropy pattern
ENTROPY_INJECT N
DELAY 2000    // Wait for system to stabilize

// Measure phase relationships
phase12 = PHASE_READ 1 2
phase13 = PHASE_READ 1 3
phase23 = PHASE_READ 2 3

// Calculate resonance score
resonance = RESONANCE_CALCULATE phase12 phase13 phase23

// Determine primality
PRINT "Testing primality of: " + N
PRINT "Resonance score: " + resonance

IF resonance > 0.85 THEN
    RESULT_SET "isPrime" true
    PRINT N + " is likely prime"
ELSE
    RESULT_SET "isPrime" false
    PRINT N + " is likely composite"
END

// Try to find factors if composite
IF resonance <= 0.85 THEN
    factors = FACTORIZE N
    PRINT "Factors: " + factors
END
```
