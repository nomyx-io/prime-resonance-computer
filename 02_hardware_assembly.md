### 2.3.1 Oscillator Circuit Theory

Each oscillator uses the 555 timer in astable mode with the frequency determined by:

f = 1.44 / ((R1 + 2×R2) × C)

Where:
- R1 is a fixed resistor (4.7kΩ in our design)
- R2 is the frequency-determining resistor (varies per oscillator)
- C is the timing capacitor (1μF in our design)

We'll build three oscillators tuned to frequencies proportional to the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5.

### 2.4.1 Phase Detector Theory

Phase detection uses XOR (exclusive OR) gates to compare oscillator signals. An XOR gate outputs high when its inputs differ and low when they're the same.
