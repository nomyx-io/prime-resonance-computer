3. Enter `help` to see available commands
4. Key diagnostic commands:
   - `status` - Shows overall system status
   - `diagnostics` - Runs a comprehensive self-test
   - `oscillator status` - Displays detailed oscillator information
   - `memory status` - Shows memory usage statistics
   - `network scan` - Scans for wireless networks and interference
   - `log level 4` - Enables verbose logging

### Hardware Diagnostics

For hardware-level diagnosis:

1. **Voltage Test Points**
   - Measure at labeled test points with a multimeter
   - TP1: 5V input (4.8V-5.2V acceptable)
   - TP2: 3.3V regulated (3.2V-3.4V acceptable)
   - TP3: Analog reference (3.3V nominal)

2. **Oscillator Outputs**
   - Measure with oscilloscope at oscillator test points
   - Check for clean square waves at expected frequencies
   - Verify duty cycle is approximately 50%
   - Check rise/fall times (<1ms)

3. **Phase Detector Testing**
   - Enter `test phase_detector` in serial console
   - System will generate known test patterns
   - Results indicate if phase detectors are working correctly

4. **Network Testing**
   - Enter `network test` in serial console
   - System will test all network connections
   - Results show signal strength and packet loss

### Factory Reset

If all else fails, perform a factory reset:

1. Power off the device
2. Hold RESET and MODE buttons simultaneously
3. Power on while holding both buttons
4. Continue holding for 5 seconds
5. Display will show "Factory Reset"
6. Confirm by pressing SELECT button
7. System will erase all settings and revert to factory defaults
8. You'll need to recalibrate and reconfigure the system

## Preventative Maintenance
