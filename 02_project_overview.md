# Project Overview

## Introduction

Before diving into the assembly details, it's important to understand the overall structure of the Prime Resonance Computer system, its components, and what you'll need to complete the build. This section provides a high-level overview of the project.

## System Architecture

The Prime Resonance Computer consists of a network of nodes (minimum of three recommended), each containing:

1. **Oscillator Array**: Multiple oscillators tuned to prime frequencies
2. **Phase Detection Network**: Circuitry to measure phase relationships between oscillators
3. **Processing Unit**: ESP32 microcontroller for measurement, control, and computation
4. **User Interface**: OLED display and optional controls
5. **Power Supply**: Regulated power for digital and analog components
6. **Communication System**: Network interfaces between nodes

The nodes work together in a coordinated network, with one node typically designated as the coordinator that manages system-wide operations.

### Node Network Topology

The nodes are arranged in a network configuration, typically:

```
    Node 2
     /   \
Node 1 --- Node 3
```

Where:
- Node 1 is usually designated as the coordinator
- All nodes communicate with each other using ESP-NOW wireless protocol
- Physical proximity within 10 meters is recommended for reliable communication

This networked architecture allows for greater computational complexity than a single node system.

## Budget Considerations

The entire three-node system can be built for under $500, with the following approximate cost breakdown:

| Category | Cost Range | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| ESP32 Modules (3) | $15-30 | Genuine ESP32 recommended |
| Electronic Components | $30-50 | ICs, passive components, etc. |
| PCBs | $30-60 | Either custom-ordered or prototype boards |
| Displays | $15-30 | OLED displays, one per node |
| Enclosures | $30-60 | Acrylic or 3D printed |
| Power Supplies | $15-30 | 5V adapters (1 per node) |
| Tools & Misc | $50-100 | Soldering equipment, wire, etc. |
| **Total** | **$185-360** | Depends on quality and source |

### Cost-Saving Tips

- Use prototype boards instead of custom PCBs
- Order components in bulk from online retailers
- 3D print enclosures if you have access to a printer
- Use generic ESP32 modules rather than branded ones
- Share tools with a local makerspace or electronics club
